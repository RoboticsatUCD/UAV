Abhinav:
1) Expand second thread and make throttle settable dynamically at run-time
2) research ESC's to see if they are closed-loop controllers (precise speeds or no)

Evan:
1) PID Tuning/Testing to make sure stable at 900+
2) Look into height control algo (using PING ultrasonic)
3) Add decal to UAV
